  block82_content:   |
   Cookies are identifiers that are transferred to your computer's hard drive through your web browser to enable our
   systems to recognize your browser. You may choose to disable all or certain cookies on your computer by modifying your
   web browser. Most web browsers allow some control of most cookies through the browser settings. To find out more about
   cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set and how to manage and delete them, visit www.aboutcookies.org
   or www.allaboutcookies.org. Please note that if you choose to disable cookies, this may impact the performance of the
   Website during your visit.

  block84_content:   |
   We use certain cookies that are strictly necessary for us to offer you the basic functionalities of our Website, to
   deliver the services you have specifically asked for and to remember your cookie settings. For instance, we use such
   cookies to allow us to identify registered visitors and ensure that they can access secure pages, to provide you with
   your language of choice based on your browser history and to enable you to share content from our Website with social
   media websites.
  block85_content:   |
   It is important to us to maintain our Website to be relevant and up to date to provide visitors with an optimal user
   experience. To achieve this goal, we use cookies often referred to as “analytic cookies” to collect information to
   help us understand how our visitors use the Website and how we can improve the Website. It is important to note that
   these cookies don’t collect information that personally identifies you. The information that is collected is anonymous
   and allows us to identify the overall patterns of usage rather than any one person’s activity. For example, these cookies
   keep track of which pages are most popular and help determine why some pages are receiving error messages
  block86_content:   |
   STC may also use logs to collect information about visitors’ use of the Website. STC may review server logs
   for security purposes, for example, to detect intrusions into our network. Server log data, which contains visitors'
   IP addresses, could in instances of criminal malfeasance be used to trace and identify individuals. In such instances,
   raw data logs would be shared with appropriate investigative bodies authorized to investigate such breaches of security.
   Like cookies, logs do not cross reference the information automatically collected with any type of personal information
   that is voluntarily offered by you on or through this Website. We do not use any behavioral advertising cookies on this
   Website.
