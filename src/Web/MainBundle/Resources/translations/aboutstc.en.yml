   LSTC-ICPC Is a team competition. Each team is made up of three people, but can only use one computer.
   </p>
   <p>
   During the competition, the teams receive about ten problems of an algorithmic nature and have
   Five hours to solve as much as possible. Concretely, the solution of a problem is to write
   A program in C, C ++ or Java which is then automatically checked on a test dataset. When
   The program is incorrect, the team can submit another solution but is penalized in time.
   </p>
   The competition is organized in several stages. Semi-finals take place in 20 regions,
   Each with up to 11 countries2. In 2016, some 22,000 students participated3. One hundred
   Teams are then selected for the final, which takes place each
   Year in a different university.
