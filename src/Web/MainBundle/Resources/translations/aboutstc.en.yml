   <p>
   STC Olympiad in Informatics (STC Olympiad in Informatics) is a
   Competition in computer science (algorithmic), bringing together high school
   whole world.
   </p>
   <p>
   Each country can send up to four candidates. Since the last year, their number is included
   Between 299 and 308. The latter take part in two five-hour events which each have three
   Problems of an algorithmic nature. The candidates  programs are then subjected to a battery of tests
   To determine the score of each.
   </p>
  title3: STC International Collegiate Programming Contest
  title3_content:  |
   <p>
   STC Web is an annual two-day conference event and one day of web development workshops.
   The event is usually held in late September or early October in Yaoundé or its suburbs since 2016 and
   Organized by our company and its partners.
   </p>
   <p>
   The event brings together every year many speakers and specialists in their field:
   Web standards, accessibility, ergonomics or design methods, but also on topical aspects
   Such as network neutrality, data protection, web design, e-commerce.
   </p>
   <p><strong>PRINCIPLE:</strong></p>
   <p>
   LSTC-ICPC Is a team competition. Each team is made up of three people, but can only use one computer.
   </p>
   <p>
   During the competition, the teams receive about ten problems of an algorithmic nature and have
   Five hours to solve as much as possible. Concretely, the solution of a problem is to write
   A program in C, C ++ or Java which is then automatically checked on a test dataset. When
   The program is incorrect, the team can submit another solution but is penalized in time.
   </p>
   The competition is organized in several stages. Semi-finals take place in 20 regions,
   Each with up to 11 countries. In 2016, some 22,000 students participated. One hundred
   Teams are then selected for the final, which takes place each
   Year in a different university.

   <p>Computer science and digital technology: what is the relationship?</p>
   <p>
   Information technology is literally shaking up the world landscape through its
   Immense variety, ranging from scientific computation and management of enterprises from the pioneering years to the
   Computerized design of everyday objects, simulation and driving of all means of transport
   And industrial processes, the upheaval of communication, access to knowledge and recreation, and
   Now those of medicine and the whole of science - all this being coordinated on the Internet
   </p>
   <p>
    We are now at the beginning of a new and equally important step: the massive computerization of
    Objects, equipped with complex electronic systems thanks to STC and its partners on a single chip, driven by elaborate and connected software
    On the large network.
   </p>
  title3: Computer time and events
  title3_content:  |
   <p>
   The role of computer time and competitions is often seen through the prism of algorithmic complexity: minimization of
   Cycle time of a circuit, the time of calculation of a program or the time of propagation of the information in a network,
   Time / space exchange in algorithms and their implementations, etc. It is in this perspective that Stc organizes since the year
   Last of many conferences and olympiads to optimize and to value the computer science and in particular the programming.
   </p>
   These issues are obviously and competitions are essential because the cost and the final benefit of an application
   Result of a subtle balance
   Between calculation time, memory size and energy expended. But algorithms and programming languages
   Do not themselves speak of time, which remains an external consideration that is not part of the specifications
   functional. This is also true of the management of the events to which the programs respond or which they generate, often
   Ad hoc treatment.
